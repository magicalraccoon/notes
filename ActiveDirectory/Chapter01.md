# A Brief Introduction

Active Directory is a repository for information about objects on a network (users, groups computers, printers, applications, and files).

Access Control Lists (ACLs) are stored with each object.
  - These maintain permissions for who can access and manage the object.

Let's learn:
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
- Kerberos
- Domain Name System (DNS)
- Multimaster Replication
- Group Policies
- Data Partitioning
- Domain Controlers,
- Password Policies

Active directory is Microsoft's Network Operating System.

It allows administrators to manage enterprise-wide information from a central repository. It's a great way to keep things organized!

## Evolution of the Microsoft NOS
A NOS environment is one or more servers that provide services such as authentication, authorization, and account manipulation to multiple end users on the service.

## A Brief History of Directories
A "directory service" is a repository of information that is useful to multiple applications and/or users. This definition is pretty vague.

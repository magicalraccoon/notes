## Linux Installation and Package Management

* Disk Partitioning
`df -h` will list free disk usage
`du -sh` will list the space files or directories take

LVM = Logical Volume Manager
  PV = Physical Volume
  VG = Volume Group
  LV = Logical Volume

`vgcreate` will create a new volume group
`lvcreate` will add it to part of a logical volume
`lvscan` will scan for all logical volumes

* Install and Configure a Boot Manager
You can install GRUB on additional drives, but you must configure it with `grub-mkconfig` or `grub2-mkconfig`.

--
* Shared Libraries
Libraries allow software to interact with the local environment.
Static and Dynamic libraries
  Static = gathered into a program at installation time
  Dynamic = accessed whenever a program needs it

ex: `libip6tc.so.0.1.0`@
  lib - library
  ip6tc - package name
  so - shared object (dynamic library)
    (static library would be "a")
  0.1.0 - version number

You can use `ldd` to display the libraries that a package depends on.
`ldconfig -p` will list all the libraries in the current cache.

Library data is stored in `/etc/ld.so.cache`, and gets information through links in `/etc/ld.so.conf`

* Package Managers
- Debian / Ubuntu -
  % Local: dpkg
    - Configured through `etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg`.
    - to directly install a package, use:
      `sudo dpkg -i my_package_2.4.1-1_amd64.deb`.
    - You can also unpack without installing by using the `--unpack` flag.
    - Packages can also be Removed (`r`), Purged (`-P`), and Reconfigured (`dpkg-reconfigure`).
    - List all currently installed packages with the `-l` flag.

  % Repositories: APT
    - you know how to do this.

- Fedora / CentOS / RHEL
  % Local: RPM
    - Similar to APT.
    - Install a package with `rpm -i software.rpm`.
    - Verify the integrity with the `-V` flag.
    - Return a file's checksum with the `-vK` flag.
    - You can also use `rpm -i --test` to check for dependencies.
  % Repositories: yum
    - Preferences are configured in `/etc/yum/repos.d/` and `/etc/yum.conf`.
    - Packages can be downloaded without installing with `yumdownloader --resolve packagename`. `--resolve` adds dependencies.
    - `yum search` and `yum info` will display detailed information.
    - .rpm files are stored as a compressed `cpio` archive.

* Test YourselfX d. Run ldconfig -u
1. Which of these is NOT commonly given its own partition?
  b. /etc

2. The primary goal of LVM is to allow you to ...
  d. Provide easy access to resources on distributed partitions
    - Files can be upgraded with `-U`.
    - The `-q` flag will display the currently installed version.
    - Remove a package with the `-e` flag.
    - To list all currently installed packages, use `rpm -q -a`.
    - For detailed information about a package, use `-qid`.

    - `yum search` and `yum info` will display detailed information.

4. Which of these is incorporated into program code during installation?
  c. Static libraries

5. Which of these will list all libraries currently stored in cache?

6. When you create your own library, you need to ...
  b. Add a file pointing to its location to the /etc/ld.so.conf.d directory

7. ____ manages online repo-based software for Red Hat Linux:
  a. YUM

8. You can install VLC on a Debian system using:
  a. apt-get install vlc

9. You can delete VLC from a Debian system using:
  d. apt-get remove VLC

10. YUM repository settings are defined by:
  d. /etc/yum.repos.d
